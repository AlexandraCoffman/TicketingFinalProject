## Set Up Environment - macOS/Linux
First, you'll need to install activate your enviroment with '. .venv/bin/activate'
Next install Flask with 'pip install Flask' though you may need to update your version with 'pip install --upgrade pip'
Then install 'pip install Flask-Login', we'll be using Flask's built-in feature for our user authentication process.

## Current Workflow
A basic user authentication system has been introduced, users can login, register, and logout of their accounts. By default, any user who creates a new account is a UserClass of (1), Customer. An organizer (2) and a operator (3) UserClass is determined through editing the csv file directly.
